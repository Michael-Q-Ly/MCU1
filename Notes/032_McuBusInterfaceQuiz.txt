Reference: STM32F429ZIT MCU

1.      Is it true that System Bus is not connected to FLASH memory?


2.      The processor can fetch instructions from SRAM over to I-code bus. T/F?


3.      System Bus can operate at a speed up to 180MHz. T/F?


4.      SRAMs are connected to System Bus. T/F?


5.      APB1 bus can operate at a speed up to 180MHz?


6.      Let's say that I have a peripheral whose datasheet says that its operating frequency or speed must
        be above 95MHz. Can I connect that peripgeral via APB2 bus? Why not?


7.      The processor can fetch instructions asa well as data simultaneously from SRAM. T/F?


8.      The processor can fetch instructions as well as data simultaneously from FLASH. T/F?


9.      What is the max HCLK clock value of the MCU?


10.     What is the max P1CLK balue of the MCU?


11.     What is the max P2CLK value of the MCU?


12.     GPIOs and processor communicate over AHB1 bus. T/F?


13.     USB OTG and processor communicate over AHB2 bus. T/F?


14.     USB OTG and GPIOs can communicate to the processor concurrently or simultaneously? T/F?


15.     The processor can talk to FLASH memory and SRAM simulatenously. T/F?
