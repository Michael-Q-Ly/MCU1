Reference: STM32F429ZIT MCU

1.      Is it true that System Bus is not connected to FLASH memory?
True. Reference manual - section 3, Fig. 3 says it is connected to I-Code and D-Code

2.      The processor can fetch instructions from SRAM over to I-code bus. T/F?
False. SRAM is connected to S-Bus.

3.      System Bus can operate at a speed up to 180MHz. T/F?
True. S-Bus is a port of  the 180MHz ARM Cortex M4 FPU.

4.      SRAMs are connected to System Bus. T/F?
True. Section 3, Fig. 3 of the reference manual shows that.

5.      APB1 bus can operate at a speed up to 180MHz?
False. APB1 has max frequency of 45MHz.

6.      Let's say that I have a peripheral whose datasheet says that its operating frequency or speed must
        be above 95MHz. Can I connect that peripgeral via APB2 bus? Why not?
You cannot connect it. APB2 has a max frequency of 90MHz.

7.      The processor can fetch instructions as well as data simultaneously from SRAM. T/F?
False. There is only one bus that connects to SRAM. We cannot simultaneously read from SRAM.

8.      The processor can fetch instructions as well as data simultaneously from FLASH. T/F?
True. We have two separate buses: I-Code and D-Code. Also notice that the flash interface has two buses that lead to it.

9.      What is the max HCLK value of the MCU?
Recall that HCLK is used to describe the operating clock frequency of the AHB Bus. In this case, it is the AHB1 and AHB2 buses.
The current operating frequency of the bus is known as HCLK.
Thus, its max value is 180MHz.

10.     What is the max P1CLK value of the MCU?
P1CLK refers to the current operating frequency of APB1 Bus, which has a max operating frequency of 45 MHz.
Thus, P1CLK has max value of 45 MHz.

11.     What is the max P2CLK value of the MCU?
P2CLK refers to current operating frequency of APB2 Bus.
Thus, P2CLK has max value 90 MHz.

12.     GPIOs and processor communicate over AHB1 bus. T/F?
True. We can take a look at the datasheet's block diagram for this.

13.     USB OTG and processor communicate over AHB2 bus. T/F?
True. USB OTG interfaces through AHB2 which then goes to AHB Bus.

14.     USB OTG and GPIOs can communicate to the processor concurrently or simultaneously? T/F?
False. Even though they use different AHB buses, once AHB1 and AHB2 reach the AHB Bus, they must be SERIALIZED because they both go to S-Bus.

15.     The processor can talk to FLASH memory and SRAM simulatenously. T/F?
True. There We can have I-Code and D-Code simultaneously talk to FLASH and S-Bus can talk to SRAM.
