Memory Map of the MCU (STM32F429ZIT)
================================================
ARM Cortex M4
Width of the system is 32 bits
The processoe can produce 2^32 different addresses (4G)
0x0000)0000 to 0xFFFF_FFFF

When the processor products 0x4002_0000 on the system bus, it
is actually referring to the GPIOA registers
