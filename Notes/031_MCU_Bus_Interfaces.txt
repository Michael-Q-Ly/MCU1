What is the base address of the flash memory of your MCU?
0x08000000

What is the bad address of the RAM memory of your MCU?
0x20000000

Notes about MCU Bus Interfaces
============================================
If the instructions are present in between the memory locations 0x00000000 to 0x1FFFFFFC, then
the Cortex processor will fetch the instructions using I-CODE interface

If the instructions are present outside of 0x00000000 to 0x1FFFFFFF, then the processor
fetches the data over D-Code bus interface

If the data is present outside of 0x00000000 to ox1FFFFFFF memory locations, then the
data will be fetched over the S-bus interface
