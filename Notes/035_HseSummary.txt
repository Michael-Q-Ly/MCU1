Summary of HSE
========================================
HSE can be provided to the MCU via a crystal or external source
(from another ckt or from another MCU)

On the STM32-DISC board, HSE is 8 MHz provided by the onboard crystal

On the NUCLEO board, HSE is of 8MHz pulled from the ST-LINK Ckt

You do not need to solder or desolder anything on your board for this course
You do not need to make any changes unless you have any special requirements
