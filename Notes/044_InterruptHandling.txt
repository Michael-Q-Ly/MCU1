Summary: Button interrupt
====================================
How does a button issue interrupts to the processor in STM32?

1.      The button is connected to a GPIO pin of the MCU

2.      The GPIO pin should be configured to input mode

3.      The link between a GPIO port and the relevant EXTI line must be
        established using the SYSCFG_EXTICRx register

4.      Configure the trigger detection (falling/rising/both) for
        relevant EXTI line (this is done via EXTI control registers)

5.      Implement the handler to service the interrupt
